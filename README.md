## Local Development

It's strongly recommended to use [nvm a.k.a Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) to manage your Node.js versions.

1. Make sure you use Node.js version 18 or higher.
     You can check this by running `node -v` in your terminal/console.

2. Make sure you have [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) installed.
     You can check this by running `yarn -v` in your terminal/console.
     You can install it by running `npm install -g yarn`.

3. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

4. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server and visit [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs)

## SEO metadata tips  
For *-api pages we can easily set common rules for generating metadata in `theme.config.tsx`.  
For other pages, sometimes we need the default values, and sometimes we need custom ones.  
Here's how metadata is being set: 

```
- /docs:
metadata set in theme.config.tsx

-- /docs/*-api: 
metadata set in theme.config.tsx

--- /docs/*-api/section: 
metadata set in theme.config.tsx

---- /docs/*-api/section/method:
metadata is auto-generated by Nextra and based on the page content 

-- /docs/any-other-page:
title and description are set via <Meta> component, all other metadata is autogenerated by Nextra
```

⚠️ It’s important to use the `<Meta>` component on pages that are not part of the Methods Documentation (i.e. `/docs/ethereum-api/` and everything inside) — otherwise the metadata will be missing. See an example of its usage in `/howitworks/overview`.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing meta title 

This code will cause title go missing, since Nextra will automatically wrap the title in the `<p>` tag
```
<Head>
  <title>
     Understanding dRPC Rate Limiting
  </title>
</Head>
```
So we'll see something like this in the resulting HTML: 
```
<title>
     <p>Understanding dRPC Rate Limiting</p>
</title>
```

Solution: keep the title in one line or use `<Meta>` component.
