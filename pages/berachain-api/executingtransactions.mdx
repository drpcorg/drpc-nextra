## Executing transactions

Facilitates the execution of smart contracts and on-chain operations.

[eth_call](/berachain-api/executingtransactions/eth_call) : Performs a read-only function invocation on a smart contract without altering the blockchain state. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/berachain-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction) : Sends a raw, signed transaction to the Berachain network for inclusion in the blockchain.

These endpoints are vital for interacting with smart contracts and initiating transactions on the Berachain network.
