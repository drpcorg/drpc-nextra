# Compute units

A compute unit is a measurement of the computational resources required to fulfill a particular request for data via JSON RPC protocol. DRPC uses CUs to calculate the cost of a request, and also to track the workload of each data provider.

## Methods costs in CU

Here is an actual method list with its CU pricing. This table is correct for all blockchains and networks that DRPC support.
If you call method that is not a part of this table, default cost is 100 CU. If you think something is wrong, ask in [our discord](https://discord.gg/drpc).

Method that require archive node have 4x multiplier.
