# Compute Units
A compute unit is a measurement of the computational resources required to fulfill a particular request for data via JSON RPC protocol. DRPC uses CUs to calculate the cost of a request, and also to track the workload of each data provider.

## Methods costs in CU

All RPC methods cost a flat 20 compute units starting Monday 2nd June. The cost is $0.30 for 1M CU. This table is correct for all blockchains and networks that DRPC support.
If you call a method that is not a part of this table, the default cost is 20 CU. If you think something is wrong, ask in [our support portal](https://support.drpc.org).

## Ethereum and EVM: Polygon, Optimism, Base, BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum
