# Compute units

A compute unit is a measurement of the computational resources required to fulfill a particular request for data via JSON RPC protocol. DRPC uses CUs to calculate the cost of a request, and also to track the workload of each data provider.

## Methods costs in CU

Here is an actual method list with its CU pricing. This table is correct for all blockchains and networks that DRPC support.
If you call a method that is not a part of this table, the default cost is 100 CU. If you think something is wrong, ask in [our discord](https://discord.gg/Kyu3zt42bJ).

Methods that require archive nodes have the same price as full nodes.
