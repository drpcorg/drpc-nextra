## Executing transactions

Facilitates sending ETH, executing smart contracts, and performing on-chain operations.

[eth_call](/arbitrum-api/executingtransactions/eth_call) : Executes a read-only call to a smart contract without broadcasting it to the network. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/arbitrum-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction) : Sends a raw, signed transaction to the blockchain for execution. \

These methods are essential for interacting with smart contracts and conducting transactions on the Arbitrum network.
