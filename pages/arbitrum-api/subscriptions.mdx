## Subscriptions

Allows you to subscribe to specific events in real-time via WebSockets.

[eth_subscribe](/arbitrum-api/subscriptions/eth_subscribe) : Subscribes to various blockchain events such as new blocks, pending transactions, or logs. \
[eth_unsubscribe](/arbitrum-api/subscriptions/eth_unsubscribe) : Unsubscribes from an existing event subscription. \

These methods are crucial for applications requiring real-time event tracking on the Arbitrum network.
