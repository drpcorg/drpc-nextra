[eth_blockNumber](/arbitrum-api/blocksinfo/eth_blockNumber) : Retrieves the latest block number. \
[eth_getBlockByHash](/arbitrum-api/blocksinfo/eth_getBlockByHash) : Fetches block details by hash. \
[eth_getBlockByHash#full](/arbitrum-api/blocksinfo/eth_getBlockByHashfull) : Retrieves full block details by hash. \
[eth_getBlockByNumber](/arbitrum-api/blocksinfo/eth_getBlockByNumber) : Retrieves block data by number. \
[eth_getBlockByNumber#full](/arbitrum-api/blocksinfo/eth_getBlockByNumberfull) : Fetches full block details by number. \
