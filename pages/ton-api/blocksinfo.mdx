## Blocks Info

Retrieves detailed information about Ton blocks, including block signatures, proofs, and shard information.

[getMasterchainInfo](/ton-api/blocksinfo/getMasterchainInfo): Provides information about the master chain, including the current state. \
[getMasterchainBlockSignatures](/ton-api/blocksinfo/getMasterchainBlockSignatures): Retrieves block signature data for enhanced security validation. \
[getShardBlockProof](/ton-api/blocksinfo/getShardBlockProof): Supplies proof information for shards in a specific block. \
[lookupBlock](/ton-api/blocksinfo/lookupBlock): Finds block details based on specific criteria, including block height or timestamp. \
[shards](/ton-api/blocksinfo/shards): Returns information on the shard layout for a specific master chain block. \
[getBlockHeader](/ton-api/blocksinfo/getBlockHeader): Retrieves headers for a specific block, containing basic metadata. \
[blocks](/ton-api/blocksinfo/blocks): Retrieves general block information from the TON blockchain, including block details like block ID, timestamp, and previous block reference. \
[masterchainBlockShards](/ton-api/blocksinfo/masterchainBlockShards): Fetches details of the shards associated with a specific masterchain block. \
[masterchainBlockShardsState](/ton-api/blocksinfo/masterchainBlockShardsState): Provides the state of each shard in a specified masterchain block.

These methods allow developers to retrieve detailed information about blocks, including master chain and shard data, enabling a deeper understanding of the blockchain's structure and history.
