## Executing transactions

Enables the sending of ETH, contract interaction, or writing data to the chain.

[eth_call](/optimism-api/executingtransactions/eth_call) : Executes a read-only call to a smart contract without changing the blockchain state.  \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/optimism-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction) : Broadcasts a raw, signed transaction to the blockchain for execution.

These methods are essential for interacting with smart contracts and sending transactions on the Optimism network.
