Enables WebSocket connections for continuous monitoring of blockchain changes.

[eth_subscribe](/optimism-api/subscriptions/eth_subscribe) : Subscribes to events such as new blocks, pending transactions, or logs. \
[eth_unsubscribe](/optimism-api/subscriptions/eth_unsubscribe) : Unsubscribes from an active WebSocket subscription.
