## Event logs

Provides logs of events emitted by smart contracts, useful for tracking token transfers and state changes.

[eth_getLogs](/ethereum-api/eventlogs/eth_getLogs) : Retrieves logs based on specified filter criteria.  \
[eth_newFilter](/ethereum-api/eventlogs/eth_newFilter) : Creates a new filter to monitor events.  \
[eth_getFilterChanges](/ethereum-api/eventlogs/eth_getFilterChanges) : Retrieves changes for an active filter since its last check.  \
[eth_uninstallFilter](/ethereum-api/eventlogs/eth_uninstallFilter) : Uninstalls an active filter.  \
[eth_getFilterLogs](/ethereum-api/eventlogs/eth_getFilterLogs) : Fetches logs from a previously created filter.

These methods are critical for monitoring smart contract activity on Ethereum.
