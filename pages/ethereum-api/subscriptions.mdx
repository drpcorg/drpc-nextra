## Subscriptions

Allows subscribing to specific Ethereum events in real-time via WebSockets.

[eth_subscribe](/ethereum-api/subscriptions/eth_subscribe) : Subscribes to various blockchain events such as new blocks, pending transactions, or logs. \
[eth_unsubscribe](/ethereum-api/subscriptions/eth_unsubscribe) : Unsubscribes from a previously created event subscription.

These methods are essential for real-time event tracking and monitoring on the Ethereum network.
