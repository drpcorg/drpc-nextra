# Teams and roles

## Teams

When you first log in and your user record is created, so does your initial team.
At first, you are the only member of this team, and you are the team **owner**.
You can send invitation for other members to their email addresses.
If needed, new team can be created using modal form on your current team page.
Currently we have a limitation of **5 teams per user**.

## Roles and members

Apart from **owner** role there are others: **admin, viewer, and treasurer**.
You can find team's members list on the bottom of the team page.
It is possible to transfer your team ownership to another team member, however your initial team is not transferable.
