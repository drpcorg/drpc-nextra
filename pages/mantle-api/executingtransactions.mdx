## Executing transactions

Provides essential methods for sending transactions, executing smart contract calls, and performing on-chain operations.

[eth_call](/mantle-api/executingtransactions/eth_call) : Executes a read-only call to a smart contract without making any state changes. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/mantle-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction) : Sends a raw, signed transaction to the Mantle network for execution.

These methods are crucial for interacting with smart contracts and conducting transactions on Mantle.
