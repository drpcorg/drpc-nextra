# Ethereum and Mantle: Differences

Mantle is a Layer 2 scaling solution based on the OP Stack architecture. While it shares design elements with Ethereum, there are important differences for developers transitioning between the two platforms.

## Block Structure

Mantle's block structure differs from Ethereum's regarding construction time, size, and other characteristics. Developers need to review Mantle's specifications to ensure proper integration.

## Network Specifications

Mantle features distinct JSON-RPC specifications compared to Ethereum. Understanding these differences is crucial for a smooth transition to Mantle.

## Transaction Costs

As a Layer 2 solution, Mantle's transaction costs differ from those on Layer 1 Ethereum. Developers should familiarize themselves with Mantle's fee structure to optimize their applications' performance.

## Solidity Support

Currently, Mantle does not support Solidity versions above v0.8.23. Developers must ensure their compiler version is compatible when deploying contracts to Mantle.
