## Debug and trace

Offers advanced debugging and tracing capabilities.

[debug_traceBlockByHash](/mantle-api/debugandtrace/debug_traceBlockByHash) : Traces the execution of a block by its hash. \
[debug_traceBlockByNumber](/mantle-api/debugandtrace/debug_traceBlockByNumber) : Traces the execution of a block by its number. \
[debug_traceTransaction](/mantle-api/debugandtrace/debug_traceTransaction) : Provides detailed trace information for a specific transaction.
