## Executing transactions

These methods are essential for interacting with smart contracts and sending transactions.

[eth_call](/base-api/executingtransactions/eth_call) : Executes a read-only call to a smart contract without making any state changes. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/base-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction) : Sends a raw, signed transaction to the Avalanche blockchain for execution.

These methods are critical for performing operations and smart contract interactions on the Base network.
