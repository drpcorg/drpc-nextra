# Ethereum and Base: Differences

Ethereum and Base are both platforms designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, yet they differ in several key aspects.

## Layer Classification

Ethereum: Ethereum operates as a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain, serving as the foundational layer where all transactions are processed and settled.

Base: Base functions as a Layer 2 (L2) solution built on top of Ethereum. It leverages Ethereum's security while aiming to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs.

## Consensus Mechanisms

Ethereum: Following its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) in September 2022, Ethereum relies on validators who stake ETH to secure the network and validate transactions.

Base: As an L2 solution, Base inherits Ethereum's security model and does not implement its own consensus mechanism. Instead, it processes transactions off-chain and periodically submits them to Ethereum for finalization.

## Transaction Speed and Fees

Ethereum: Ethereum's transaction throughput is approximately 15 transactions per second (TPS), which can lead to network congestion and high gas fees during peak periods.

Base: By processing transactions off-chain and bundling them before submitting to Ethereum, Base achieves higher throughput and significantly lower fees, making it more cost-effective for users.

## Ecosystem and Adoption

Ethereum: As a pioneer in smart contracts, Ethereum boasts a vast ecosystem with a robust developer community, numerous dApps, and extensive support for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Base: Launched by Coinbase, Base is relatively new but has rapidly gained traction, especially in DeFi. Its compatibility with Ethereum allows developers to migrate existing applications seamlessly.

## Smart Contract Compatibility

Ethereum: Ethereum utilizes the Solidity programming language for smart contract development, supported by a large pool of developers and extensive resources.

Base: Base maintains full compatibility with Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts without modification.

## Governance

Ethereum: Ethereum's governance is community-driven, with decisions made through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that require broad consensus among stakeholders.

Base: Currently, Base's governance is more centralized, with Coinbase overseeing its development. However, there are plans to progressively decentralize its governance structure over time.
