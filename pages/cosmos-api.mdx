# Cosmos API Overview

Welcome to the Cosmos API Quickstart and Reference Guide. This guide provides everything you need to start building on Cosmos using dRPCâ€™s JSON-RPC API. Whether you're retrieving account balances, fetching block details, executing transactions, or estimating gas fees, this comprehensive guide will help you integrate Cosmos seamlessly into your applications.

This page includes:

- A **Quickstart Guide** to help you set up and make your first Cosmos API request.
- A detailed list of **all Cosmos API methods**, categorized for easy reference.

## Cosmos API Quickstart

To get started with building on Cosmos using dRPC's Cosmos RPC API, follow these steps:

**1. Create a dRPC Account or Use Public Cosmos RPC endpoints**

By signing up for a free dRPC account, you can access their Premium Cosmos RPC endpoints.

**Public endpoints:**

HTTPS

```bash
https://cosmos.drpc.org/
```

WSS:

```bash
wss://cosmos.drpc.org
```

**2. Set Up Your Development Environment**

RPC can be requested in [various ways](https://drpc.org/docs/gettingstarted/firstrequest). In this example, we are going to use Node.js. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your system. You can verify their installation by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If not installed, download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

**3. Initialize Your Project**

Create a new directory for your project and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir Cosmos-drpc-quickstart
cd Cosmos-drpc-quickstart
npm init --yes
```

**4. Install Axios**

Axios is a popular HTTP client for making API requests. Install it using npm:

```bash
npm install axios
```

**5. Obtain dRPC Endpoint**

Log in to your dRPC account and navigate to the Cosmos RPC endpoints section. Copy the HTTPS endpoint URL for the Cosmos Mainnet.

**6. Write Your First Script**

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and add the following code:

```jsx
const axios = require('axios');

const url = 'https://lb.drpc.org/ogrpc?network=cosmos&dkey=YOUR_DRPC_API_KEY'; // Replace with your actual Cosmos RPC endpoint

const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 'cosmos-api',
  method: 'status',
  params: []
};

axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Node status:', response.data.result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching node status:', error);
  });
```

Replace `https://lb.drpc.org/ogrpc?network=cosmos&dkey=YOUR_DRPC_API_KEY` with the actual endpoint URL you obtained from dRPC.

**7. Run Your Script**

Execute your script using Node.js:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the latest Cosmos block number printed in your console.

**Additional Information**

dRPC offers various features such as high performance nodes, access to multiple chains..

By following these steps, you can start building on Cosmos using dRPC's reliable and efficient RPC endpoints. For more details use [Cosmos Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network).

## Cosmos API Methods


The Cosmos blockchain network, designed as an ecosystem of connected blockchains, provides similar retrieval methods for managing transactions, block data, consensus information, and node operations. Below is a breakdown of Cosmos-specific categories and methods.

## Blocks info

Retrieves details about specific blocks and their contents.

[block](/cosmos-api/blocksinfo/block) : Retrieves detailed information about a specific block. \
[block_by_hash](/cosmos-api/blocksinfo/block_by_hash) : Fetches a block by its hash. \
[block_results](/cosmos-api/blocksinfo/block_results) : Provides the result of all transactions in a block. \
[block_search](/cosmos-api/blocksinfo/block_search) : Searches for blocks using specific criteria. \
[blockchain](/cosmos-api/blocksinfo/blockchain) : Retrieves metadata for a series of blocks. \
[header](/cosmos-api/blocksinfo/header) : Fetches block headers. \
[header_by_hash](/cosmos-api/blocksinfo/header_by_hash) : Retrieves block headers by hash. \
[commit](/cosmos-api/blocksinfo/commit) : Provides the block commit details.

## Chain info

Allows to gather detailed information about the current state and configuration of the blockchain.

[abci_info](/cosmos-api/chaininfo/abci_info) : Provides information about the ABCI application state. \
[abci_query](/cosmos-api/chaininfo/abci_query) : Queries the application for state information. \
[genesis_chunked](/cosmos-api/chaininfo/genesis_chunked) : Retrieves the genesis file in chunks. \
[health](/cosmos-api/chaininfo/health) : Checks the health of the node. \
[lag_status](/cosmos-api/chaininfo/lag_status) : Displays the lag status of the node. \
[status](/cosmos-api/chaininfo/status) : Fetches the current status of the node.


## Consensus info

Ensures that validators agree on the state of the blockchain.

[consensus_params](/cosmos-api/consensusinfo/consensus_params) : Retrieves the parameters governing the consensus process. \
[consensus_state](/cosmos-api/consensusinfo/consensus_state) : Returns the current state of the consensus algorithm. \
[dump_consensus_state](/cosmos-api/consensusinfo/dump_consensus_state) : Provides a detailed dump of the consensus state for debugging.

## Transactions info

Provides access to information about on-chain transactions and their current state.

[broadcast_tx](/cosmos-api/transactionsinfo/broadcast_tx) : Broadcasts a transaction to the network without waiting for its inclusion in a block. \
[broadcast_tx_commit](/cosmos-api/transactionsinfo/broadcast_tx_commit) : Broadcasts a transaction and waits for its inclusion in a block. \
[check_tx](/cosmos-api/transactionsinfo/check_tx) : Checks a transaction for validity without broadcasting it. \
[num_unconfirmed_txs](/cosmos-api/transactionsinfo/num_unconfirmed_txs) : Returns the number of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. \
[tx](/cosmos-api/transactionsinfo/tx) : Retrieves details of a specific transaction by its hash. \
[tx_search](/cosmos-api/transactionsinfo/tx_search) : Searches for transactions based on criteria.
