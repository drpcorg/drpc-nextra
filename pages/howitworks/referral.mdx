# dRPC Referral Program

This program allows you to earn rewards by inviting your friends and colleagues to join the dRPC platform. By displaying your badge and sharing your personalized referral link, you can introduce other Web3 developers to the benefits of dRPC and earn additional income from their account top-ups.

## How It Works

The process is simple and rewarding. Just follow these steps:

### 1. Obtain Your dRPC Referral Link

- Log in to your dRPC account, go to “Settings,” and click on the “Referrals” tab.
- There you’ll find your personal referral link containing a code unique to you.
- This link will help track your referrals and ensure you receive your rewards.

### 2. Share Your Referral Link

Post your referral link on social media, send it to friends via email or place the dRPC badge on your website. The more you share, the greater your chances of earning rewards!

### 3. Add the dRPC Badge to Your Website

This step isn’t required, but is highly recommended. Displaying the badge on your website will make it easier for visitors to see and use your referral link.

- Choose a style: Go for the “Dark” theme or the “Light” theme to fit your site’s design.
- You can find the badge code in your dRPC dashboard under the “Referrals” section or below.
- Replace “YOUR_REFERRAL_CODE” with your actual referral code. You can find this in the "Referrals" section of your dRPC account.
- Insert the code into your website’s HTML where you want the badge to appear. Ensure it’s in a visible location so your visitors can easily click on it.
- You’re free to modify the image and URL of the badge to match your site’s design and action needs.
