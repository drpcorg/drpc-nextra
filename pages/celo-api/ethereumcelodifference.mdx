# Ethereum and Celo: Difference Ethereum and Celo are blockchain platforms designed
for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. While they have similarities,
they are distinct in their features and focus.

## Layer and Purpose

Ethereum: Ethereum is a foundational Layer 1 blockchain that processes and finalizes transactions directly on its network.

Celo: Celo is also a Layer 1 blockchain but focuses on accessibility for mobile users, aiming to provide financial services to people with smartphones.

## Consensus Mechanism

Ethereum: Since adopting Proof of Stake (PoS) in 2022, Ethereum relies on validators who stake ETH to secure the network and confirm transactions.

Celo: Celo uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) PoS system that allows faster block times—around 5 seconds—offering near-instant transaction finality.

## Speed and Costs

Ethereum: Transaction speeds on Ethereum average about 15 transactions per second (TPS). During peak activity, the network often faces congestion, leading to high gas fees.

Celo: Celo is designed for speed and efficiency, with faster transaction finality and much lower fees, making it ideal for cost-sensitive and time-critical applications.

## Ecosystem and Adoption

Ethereum: As a pioneer in blockchain technology, Ethereum has a broad and mature ecosystem with strong developer support, countless dApps, and extensive adoption in DeFi and NFT spaces.

Celo: While smaller and newer, Celo is growing rapidly, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi). It allows developers to create customized blockchains for specific needs, enhancing flexibility and scalability.

## Smart Contract Development

Ethereum: Ethereum uses Solidity, its native programming language, to build smart contracts. This well-established language comes with a vast community and extensive resources.

Celo: Celo supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, making it easy for developers to migrate or build Ethereum-based projects. Additionally, it supports multiple programming languages, offering flexibility for developers.

## Governance

Ethereum: Governance on Ethereum is community-driven, with decisions made through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). While inclusive, this process can be time-consuming.

Celo: Celo’s governance is more centralized, with decisions guided by its core team and validators. This allows for faster decision-making but raises some concerns about decentralization compared to Ethereum.
