# Ethereum vs. Polygon: Differences

Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to enhance Ethereum’s capabilities by providing quicker and more cost-effective transactions through sidechains. This guide explores the fundamental differences between Polygon and Ethereum, covering aspects such as total value locked (TVL), market capitalization, consensus algorithms, transactions per second (TPS), tokenomics, and decentralization.

## Overview

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Launched in 2015, it introduced a revolutionary way for developers to build on a global network. In contrast, Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, operates as a decentralized platform on the Ethereum blockchain, offering lower transaction costs and faster speeds, making it appealing for developers of high-frequency applications, such as gaming.

Both networks utilize Solidity as their programming language for smart contracts and support various use cases, including NFTs, stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, while Polygon boasts significantly lower fees, Ethereum maintains a higher TVL, indicating its stronger foothold in the DeFi space.

## What is Polygon?

Polygon serves as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, facilitating faster and cheaper transactions via sidechains. These sidechains are linked to the main Ethereum blockchain through a two-way peg, allowing seamless data and asset transfers while retaining Ethereum's security features. By offloading transactions to these less congested sidechains, Polygon improves speed and reduces costs for users and developers alike.

Key Characteristics of Polygon:
Scalability: Offloads transactions from Ethereum’s main chain, resulting in faster processing times.
Low Transaction Costs: Significantly more affordable than Ethereum, attracting users seeking economical solutions.
Compatibility: Fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to use the same tools and languages as on Ethereum.
Modularity: Offers customizable blockchain environments for different use cases.
Limitations of Polygon:
Centralization Concerns: Relies on a set of validators for transaction verification, which could theoretically lead to collusion.
Adoption Rate: Still growing its user base compared to Ethereum.
Functionality: While versatile, Polygon may not match the comprehensive capabilities of Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that executes smart contracts—self-executing applications that operate without interruptions or third-party interference. It was the first blockchain to enable developers to build dApps on a global scale.

Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to validate transactions, transitioning from proof-of-work (PoW) in late 2021. Its programming language, Solidity, is used for creating smart contracts, facilitating the automated exchange of valuable assets.

Key Features of Ethereum:
Smart Contracts: Allows developers to create contracts with predetermined conditions coded within.
DApps: Supports a wide range of decentralized applications free from central control.
Programming Language Support: Accommodates various languages, fostering a diverse developer community.
Ecosystem: Features a robust ecosystem with numerous tools, resources, and an active developer base.
Security: Maintains a strong security record since its inception.
Limitations of Ethereum:
Scalability Issues: Has faced challenges with transaction capacity, particularly during periods of high demand. Future upgrades like sharding aim to improve this.
Complexity: The ecosystem can be complicated for newcomers, requiring a solid understanding of programming and cryptography.
Cost: Transaction fees can be high, especially during network congestion.
Total Value Locked (TVL)

## Tokenomics

Ethereum's native token, ETH, serves as “gas” for transactions and smart contracts. Its total supply is not capped, but EIP-1559 introduced a deflationary mechanism by burning a portion of transaction fees.

Polygon's native token, MATIC, has a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens. MATIC is used for staking by validators, paying transaction fees, and participating in governance.

## Decentralization

Ethereum is highly decentralized, with a global network of nodes ensuring no central point of failure. While Polygon is designed as a decentralized network, it does exhibit certain centralization aspects due to its reliance on a set of validators.
