## Executing transactions

Provides essential methods for sending transactions, executing smart contract calls, and performing on-chain operations.

[eth_call](/polygon-api/executingtransactions/eth_call) : Executes a read-only call to a smart contract without modifying the blockchain state. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/polygon-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction) : Sends a raw, signed transaction to the blockchain for execution.

These methods are critical for interacting with smart contracts and conducting transactions on the Polygon network.
