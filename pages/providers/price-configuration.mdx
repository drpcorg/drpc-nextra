# Price configuration

dRPC provides pay as you go pricing for our clients, meaning the pay for each call. Each call has a price in terms
of CU (compute units), you can [read more here](../pricing/compute-units.mdx).

But providers can redefine those values for themselves through provider dashboard using CU lang.

## CU lang

We provide a small configuration language that allows to set prices.
If you're familiar with CSS, it's very similar and allows you to easily augment prices for borad range of methods.

### Example

```
// multiplies all prices by 0.9
* {
  mul: 0.9;
}

// all methods for solana will use 100% of CU
$solana {
  mul: 1;
}

// drops price by 50% on all network for eth_call method
#eth_call {
  mul: 0.5;
}

// only drop price by 20% for eth_call on metis
$metis #eth_call {
  mul: 0.8;
}

// all archive eth_call on ethereum will have 100% price
$ethereum #eth_call archive {
  mul: 1;
}

// both networks will use 100% of CU
$metis, $manta-pacific {
  mul: 1;
}

// adds discount for all requests in US-East
region(US-East) {
  mul: 0.9;
}

```

### Anatomy of pricing rule

Each rule consists of 2 parts: selector and modifier.

- selector allows to specify for which call modifier should apply
- modifier augments the prices for selected calls

### Modifiers

Currently we only support `mul` modifier. This modifier takes base price of the call and multiplies it by specified number.
Currently we only allow float values between 0 and 1, so base price is currently price ceiling, but it can change in future.

### Selectors

There are several types of selectors

- all (`*`) selector, applies to all calls
- method selector (`#eth_call`), applies to all calls of specifci methods
- network selector (`$solana`), applies to all calls of specific networks
- archive selector (`archive`), applies to all archive calls
- region selector (`region(US-East)`), applies to all methods in specified region. Current regions are:
  - US-East
  - US-Central
  - Asia-East
  - Asia-SouthEast
  - EU-West
  - SA-East

#### Selectors composability

- `*` is not composable, you can only use it alone
- you can increase specificity of selector using several different types of selectors together `$ethereum #eth_call archive`, but you can only use 1 type of each selector
- you can combine several selectors in one using `,`. For example, `#eth_call, #eth_getLogs`.

#### Specificity

Obviously, you can have a lot of rules in your configuration and each call can match several rules.
However, we need to select one to apply its modifier, so there is a concept of specificity.

It works the same as with CSS. Basically we take selector and convert it to binary number using order below:

1. method selector
2. network selector
3. region selector
4. archive selector
5. all selector

For example, let's compare 2 selectors: `#eth_call` and `$metis archive`.

Selector `#eth_call` converts to `10000`:

1. method selector (1)
2. network selector (0)
3. region selector (0)
4. archive selector (0)
5. all selector (0)

Selector `$metis archive` converts to `01010`:

1. method selector (0)
2. network selector(1)
3. region selector (0)
4. archive selector (1)
5. all selector (0)

Now we just compare those 2 numbers and `10000` > `01010`, so the selector `#eth_call`
will have more specificity, thus it will overpower any other selector matching any eth_call.
