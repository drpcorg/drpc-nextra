# Dshackle setup instructions

Dshackle is a proxy used by dRPC as an entry point for your provider. It allows you to aggregate multiple nodes under one provider and to route JSON-RPC requests to specific nodes based on their capabilities or special requirements (e.g., trace calls).

## Dshackle Deployment Considerations

**Running multiple Dshackle servers behind a single DNS name is not supported.** If you want to run multiple Dshackle servers (in the same region or in different regions), please deploy each server with its own DNS name and an SSL certificate for that name.

### Common Dshackle Deployment Schemes:

- **One Dshackle server per data center**: For example, if you have blockchain nodes in a data center in Frankfurt, you can deploy a Dshackle server in the same data center and connect the nodes you host there to it.
- **Multiple Dshackle servers per data center**: If you'd like to add redundancy and fault tolerance, you can deploy several Dshackle servers in the same data center. Each one must have its own DNS name and SSL certificate. You can then connect your blockchain nodes to both Dshackle servers.

## Provider name

Your provider name is a unique identifier for your nodes in dRPC. The convention is to name it using `your-company-name` + `any-suffix`.

## Install Dshackle

The easiest way to install Dshackle is by using the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/drpcorg/dshackle).

## Docker-compose example

Create `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  dshackle:
    container_name: dshackle
    image: drpcorg/dshackle:latest
    volumes:
      - "/path_to_config/dshackle.yaml:/etc/dshackle/dshackle.yaml"
      - "/path_to_ssl_certs:/path_to_ssl_certs"
      - "/path_to_keys:/path_to_keys"
    ports:
      - "12448:12448"
```

You can start it by `docker compose up -d` command.

## Minimal provider config

This configuration defines the simplest possible provider with two nodes that will serve requests. You can add any number of additional nodes as needed.

Note: We expect you to set up your Dshackle instance with TLS enabled and a valid SSL certificate.

***ATTENTION***: Connect your nodes to Dshackle **ONLY** directly, without any load balancers in between. Using a load balancer between your nodes and Dshackle can lead to errors and inconsistent node states. Dshackle acts as a load balancer itself.

```yaml
version: v1
port: 12448
host: 0.0.0.0

tls:
  enabled: true
  server:
    certificate: /path_to_ssl_certs/your_ssl_cert.crt
    key: /path_to_ssl_certs/your_ssl_key.p8.key

auth:
  enabled: true
  publicKeyOwner: drpc # always drpc
  server:
    keys:
      provider-private-key: /path_to_keys/private-provider-name.p8.key
      external-public-key: /path_to_keys/public-drpc.pem

cluster:
  upstreams:
    - id: ethnode1
      chain: ethereum
      method-groups:
        enabled:
          - trace
          - filter # only if you are running nethermind or erigon node
      connection:
        generic:
          rpc:
            url: "http://example1.com:8545"
          ws:
            url: "ws://example1.com:8545"
    - id: ethnode2
      chain: ethereum
      method-groups:
        enabled:
          - trace
      connection:
        generic:
          rpc:
            url: "http://example2.com:8545"
          ws:
            url: "ws://example2.com:8545"
```

## Archive nodes

Dshackle automatically detects the node type (full or archive). If you have any concerns about how your node was detected on the dRPC side, please reach out to the dRPC developers in your dedicated Discord channel.

## Filter nodes

There is a group of methods that allow you to create custom filters:

```
eth_newFilter
eth_newBlockFilter
eth_newPendingTransactionFilter
eth_getFilterChanges
eth_getFilterLogs
eth_uninstallFilter
```

These methods are quite tricky to support because they require something like "sticky sessions" for nodes, which is implemented in dRPC. However, not all execution clients support all of them. Currently, we have tested and confirmed that everything works well with the following:

1. Nethermind
2. Erigon
3. Geth works, but it is very slow for `eth_getFilterLogs`, so we do not recommend using it for those requests

If you're confident that all the methods mentioned above are working correctly on your node, please mark it accordingly in the configuration:

```yaml
id: ethnode1
chain: ethereum
method-groups:
  enabled:
    - filter 
connection:
  generic:
    rpc:
      url: "http://example1.com:8545"
    ws:
      url: "ws://example1.com:8545"
```

This way, dRPC will know it can route filter requests to your Dshackle server, which will handle routing those requests to your marked nodes.

## Arbitrum and Optimism redirects

As a client, if you try to ask Arbitrum node something like `eth_call` with a block tag before Nitro upgrade, your Arbitrum Nitro node won’t be able to perform this request on its own, and there is a [redirect feature](https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq#is-there-any-way-to-retrieve-prenitro-archive-data-from-a-nitro-node) that will redirect this request to an Arbitrum classic node.

Basically, the [same happened](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/overview#legacy-geth) with Optimism Bedrock upgrade.

On our side, we want to distinguish providers who can serve requests from historical nodes, so there are two separate labels:

```
has_pre_bedrock_redirect: true // optimism 
has_pre_nitro_redirect: true // arbitrum
```

If you have Arbitrum/Optimism nodes which setup to handle historical requests, don’t forget to add a corresponding label to this node; otherwise, dRPC won’t route those requests to your provider.

## Full configuration reference

You can find detailed documentation on all available configuration options [here](https://github.com/drpcorg/dshackle/blob/master/docs/reference-configuration.adoc).

## Reload config

You can change all configurations under `cluster` in your `dshackle.yaml` and then reload it in order to pick them up without dshackle restart.

You can do it via sending a `kill` command with `HUP` signal to your container, for example `docker kill --signal SIGHUP ${containerId}`. And then you will see the reloading logs.

**Attention**: your volume in docker with `dshackle.yaml` must not be with `ro` modifier otherwise reload config doesn't work.

## Authorization

Our authorization algorithm is based on public/private key pairs and JWT tokens. We hold our private key and your public key, while you retain your private key and our public key. Using these keys, both sides generate JWT tokens, verify their validity, and if the verification succeeds, authorization is successfully established.

Currently, we support only RSA keys. You can use the following script to generate a key pair, specifying the key suffix as the first argument:

`rsa-key-generator.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [ -z "$1" ]
  then
    echo "Please, specify key suffix"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Generating RSA key pair"

openssl genrsa -out private-$1.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private-$1.pem -pubout -out public-$1.pem
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in private-$1.pem -out private-$1.p8.key -nocrypt
rm private-$1.pem

echo "Key pair is generated"
```

For example, if you want to generate your pair with the `provider-name` suffix, you would execute `./rsa-key-generator.sh provider-name`. After that, you will receive a pair of keys: a private key named `private-provider-name.p8.key` and a public key named `public-provider-name.pem`. Please share your **public key** with us. You can share it in your dedicated channel on our Discord server.

To enable authentication, add the following configuration to your `dshackle.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  enabled: true
  publicKeyOwner: drpc # always drpc
  server:
    keys:
      provider-private-key: /path_to_keys/private-provider-name.p8.key # your private key
      external-public-key: /path_to_keys/public-drpc.pem # dRPC public key
```

`external-public-key` is the dRPC public key `public-drpc.pem`:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAmi3CFtWG5a2NNXazozqX
ie8BckDC7BeH+0bF/GfU/HwhR+4q89s4RhnT+mGGo9egty9rRPESF91pKsy8Co8g
dBJ+jKxToCTXVN2L4BxnF6dr8FT55qrYFojobQcWrQNI4sl/X0OLscAHJegL9sH3
QNBMv0MiFk8NmXTCjFNKvTXinBlQ99VEVVVjert6KB6TRVjrEnyyPNBFMaQg2Cjz
j212Gnc/d32s5O9/9ABvdQjPYLQSM5YvNN4BsAyo2ij2fjDAnt6dYAMnTUs9deA5
4m8ME6+x5tqvAkK4aOM4AtgBrPuoezM1/euGE7hwJeL1z/RFNIkyZJcG7Mk9xI7/
0wIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Don't forget to add an additional volume (if it's necessary) with `path_to_keys` path.

**Attention**: Using this form of authorization does not imply that you can remove the TLS section from your configuration without taking further action. Your connection must remain secure. You can use your own SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt), or you can remove the TLS configuration and utilize TLS termination on your reverse proxy.

For example, you can add the following configuration for TLS with your own SSL certificate and key

```yaml
tls:
  enabled: true
  server:
    certificate: /path_to_ssl_certs/your_ssl_cert.crt
    key: /path_to_ssl_certs/your_ssl_key.p8.key
```

### Dshackle behind a reverse proxy

<Image src={proxy} alt="Reverse proxy" sizes="55vw" />

Dshackle can work behind a reverse proxy. You need to terminate SSL on your reverse proxy and run Dshackle with TLS disabled.

Example of a `docker-compose` configuration with Traefik that proxies port `12448` to `12448` on Dshackle:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:latest
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "12448:12448"
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--entryPoints.grpc.address=:12448"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=$MAIL"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
    volumes:
      - "./traefik/letsencrypt:/letsencrypt"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
  dshackle:
    image: drpcorg/dshackle:latest
    volumes:
      - "/path_to_config/dshackle.yaml:/etc/dshackle/dshackle.yaml"
      - "/path_to_keys:/path_to_keys"
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.drpc.loadbalancer.server.scheme=h2c"
      - "traefik.http.services.drpc.loadbalancer.server.port=12448"
      - "traefik.http.routers.drpc.entrypoints=grpc"
      - "traefik.http.routers.drpc.tls.certresolver=myresolver"
      - "traefik.http.routers.drpc.rule=Host(`$DOMAIN`)"
```

Example of a Nginx configuration:

```nginx
location / {
    set $host_grpc_pass "grpc://<dshackle-server-address>:<dshackle-server-port>";
    grpc_pass $host_grpc_pass;
}
```

Example of a `ingress-nginx` configuration:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: GRPC
```

### Using Other Reverse Proxies

The most important requirement is that your reverse proxy must support gRPC, as dRPC communicates with your Dshackle server using the gRPC protocol.

## Creating dRPC account

Providers can use dRPC for free, as long as they use it to query their own infrastructure. The benefits include:

1. A single interface for all your endpoints and keys
2. Detailed statistics
3. Automatic fallback mechanism

Also, we need to associate your account with a specific provider in our dRPC configuration. For now, this is done manually. The association is based on your Team ID.

### Register on drpc.org

1. Go to https://drpc.org
2. Select your preferred authorization method (MetaMask, email, etc)
3. Go to `Settings` -> `Team`
4. Copy your `Team ID` and send it to us in your dedicated channel on our Discord server

## Heap dumps

It's possible to collect heap dumps from Dshackle server during `OutOfMemoryError`. It could be very important for us for further troubleshooting and improve our service, send them to us as soon as possible. It's automated but it's necessary to do one thing - add another volume in your docker config - `/path_to_dumps:/etc/dshackle/dumps`.

If everything is OK, you won't see any output. Otherwise, you may see logs such as `Heap dump creation is turned off` or `$path does not exist`.

If an `OutOfMemoryError` is thrown, heap dumps will be created in the folder specified in your Docker config. If that happens, you'll see a log message during the next Dshackle startup: `There are some heap dumps, please send them to Dshackle developers.`

This message will be printed periodically as a reminder that heap dumps are present.

Max number of heap dumps in the folder is 3. Dshackle monitors it and automatically clears extra dumps if necessary.

## Additional info

Since **1.10.0** version ([for more info](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0)) geth abandoned of indexing all transactions by default (they take transactions from **2,350,000** last blocks). Because of that tx methods like `eth_getTransactionByHash` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` return null for old blocks. If you wish to disable transaction unindexing altogether, you can run Geth with --txlookuplimit=0. Please take this into account if you have geth nodes.

## Dshackle Upgrade

We release new versions of Dshackle quite often, improving stability and performance while adding support for new networks. Providers should stay up to date and install new versions as soon as possible, as using outdated versions may impact your earnings on our platform.

You can track updates through the following methods:
- dRPC Discord – Channel `#announcements` in the Providers section
- GitHub Releases – https://github.com/drpcorg/dshackle/releases

You can subscribe to new releases on GitHub through various options, such as GitHub Notifications (Watching) or external services like https://newreleases.io
