# Dshackle setup instructions

## Provider name

Your provider name is a unique identifier for your nodes in dRPC. The convention is to name it using `your-company-name` + `any-suffix`.

## Install Dshackle

Dshackle is a proxy used by dRPC as an entry point for your provider. It allows you to aggregate multiple nodes behind one provider and custom route JSON-RPC requests to specific nodes if they have specific needs (e.g., trace calls).

The easiest way to install Dshackle is to use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/drpcorg/dshackle).

An alternative way is to build it from source using this [repository](https://github.com/p2p-org/dshackle).

## Docker-compose example

Create `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  dshackle:
    container_name: dshackle
    image: drpcorg/dshackle:latest
    volumes:
      - "/path_to_config/dshackle.yaml:/etc/dshackle/dshackle.yaml"
      - "/path_to_ssl_certs:/path_to_ssl_certs"
      - "/path_to_keys:/path_to_keys"
    ports:
      - "12448:12448"
```

You can start it by `docker compose up -d` command.

## Minimal provider config

This configuration defines the simplest possible provider with two nodes that will serve the requests. You can add any number of nodes.

Note: We expect you to set up your Dshackle with TLS enabled and valid SSL certificate.

***ATTENTION***: Connect your nodes to dshackle **ONLY** directly without any load balancers between them. Otherwise, there will be errors and problems with the state of your nodes. Dshackle is balancer itself.

```yaml
version: v1
port: 12448
host: 0.0.0.0

tls:
  enabled: true
  server:
    certificate: /path_to_ssl_certs/your_ssl_cert.crt
    key: /path_to_ssl_certs/your_ssl_key.p8.key

auth:
  enabled: true
  publicKeyOwner: drpc
  server:
    keys:
      provider-private-key: /path_to_keys/private-provider-name.p8.key
      external-public-key: /path_to_keys/public-drpc.pem

cluster:
  upstreams:
    - id: ethnode1
      chain: ethereum
      method-groups:
        enabled:
          - trace
          - filter #only if you are running nethermind or erigon node
      connection:
        ethereum-pos:
          execution:
            rpc:
              url: "http://example2.com:8545"
            ws:
              url: "ws://example2.com:8545"
    - id: ethnode2
      chain: ethereum
      labels:
        archive: true
      method-groups:
        enabled:
          - trace
      connection:
        ethereum-pos:
          execution:
            rpc:
              url: "http://example1.com:8545"
            ws:
              frameSize: 20Mb
              msgSize: 50Mb
              url: "ws://example1.com:8545"
```

## Archive nodes

If you have archive nodes, you must mark them with the `archive` label, as shown in the example:

```yaml
id: ethnode2
chain: ethereum
labels:
  archive: true
connection:
  ethereum-pos:
    execution:
      rpc:
        url: "http://example1.com:8545"
      ws:
        frameSize: 20Mb
        msgSize: 50Mb
        url: "ws://example1.com:8545"
```

## Filter nodes

There are a group of methods that allow you to create custom filters:

```
eth_newFilter
eth_newBlockFilter
eth_newPendingTransactionFilter
eth_getFilterChanges
eth_getFilterLogs
eth_uninstallFilter
```

They are quite tricky to support because they require something like "sticky sessions" for nodes, which is implemented in dRPC. However, not all execution clients implement all of these methods. Currently, we have tested and confirmed that everything works well with the following:

1. Nethermind
2. Erigon
3. Geth works, but it is very slow for `eth_getFilterLogs`; therefore, we do not recommend using it for those requests.

So, if you’re confident that all the methods mentioned above are working correctly for your node, additionally mark it in the configuration:

```yaml
id: ethnode2
chain: ethereum
method-groups:
  enabled:
    - filter 
connection:
  ethereum-pos:
    execution:
      rpc:
        url: "http://example1.com:8545"
      ws:
        frameSize: 20Mb
        msgSize: 50Mb
        url: "ws://example1.com:8545"
```

This way, dRPC will know that it can route filter requests to your operator, and Dshackle will handle the routing of those requests to your marked nodes.

## Arbitrum and Optimism redirects

As a client, if you try to ask Arbitrum node something like `eth_call` with a block tag before Nitro upgrade, your Arbitrum Nitro node won’t be able to perform this request on its own, and there is a [redirect feature](https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq#is-there-any-way-to-retrieve-prenitro-archive-data-from-a-nitro-node) that will redirect this request to an Arbitrum classic node.

Basically, the [same happened](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/overview#legacy-geth) with Optimism Bedrock upgrade.

On our side, we want to distinguish providers who can serve requests from historical nodes, so there are two separate labels:

```
has_pre_bedrock_redirect: true // optimism 
has_pre_nitro_redirect: true // arbitrum
```

If you have Arbitrum/Optimism nodes which setup to handle historical requests, don’t forget to add a corresponding label to this node; otherwise, dRPC won’t route those requests to your provider.

## Full configuration reference

You can find detailed documentation on all possible configuration options [here](https://github.com/p2p-org/dshackle/blob/master/docs/reference-configuration.adoc).

## Reload config

You can change all configurations under `cluster` in your `dshackle.yaml` and then reload it in order to pick them up without dshackle restart.

You can do it via sending a `kill` command with `HUP` signal to your container, for example `docker kill --signal SIGHUP ${containerId}`. And then you will see the reloading logs.

**Attention**: your volume in docker with `dshackle.yaml` must not be with `ro` modifier otherwise reload config doesn't work.

## Mutual Authorization

Previously, we also used TLS for mutual authorization - you provided us with your CA, and we provided ours. This ensured that we were who we said we were, and you were who you said you were. However, the process of manually generating certificates could be tricky and might cause further issues if something were configured incorrectly. That’s why we’ve decided to revise our mutual authorization approach.

Our new authorization algorithm is based on private/public key pairs and JWT tokens. We hold our private key and your public key, while you possess your own private key and our public key. Using these keys, we generate JWT tokens on both sides, verify their validity, and if they are confirmed to be valid, authorization is successfully achieved.

Currently, we support only RSA keys. You can use the following script to generate such a pair, specifying the key suffix as the first argument. 

`rsa-key-generator.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [ -z "$1" ]
  then
    echo "Please, specify key suffix"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Generating RSA key pair"

openssl genrsa -out private-$1.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private-$1.pem -pubout -out public-$1.pem
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in private-$1.pem -out private-$1.p8.key -nocrypt
rm private-$1.pem

echo "Key pair is generated"
```

For example, if you want to generate your pair with the `provider-name` suffix, you would execute `./rsa-key-generator.sh provider-name`. After that, you will receive a pair of keys: a private key named `private-provider-name.p8.key` and a public key named `public-provider-name.pem`. Please share your **public key** with us.

Now it's necessary to configure dshackle to work with the new auth process. For that you must add the following configuration to your `dshackle.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  enabled: true
  publicKeyOwner: drpc
  server:
    keys:
      provider-private-key: /path_to_keys/private-provider-name.p8.key
      external-public-key: /path_to_keys/public-drpc.pem
```

`external-public-key` is the dRPC public key `public-drpc.pem`:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAmi3CFtWG5a2NNXazozqX
ie8BckDC7BeH+0bF/GfU/HwhR+4q89s4RhnT+mGGo9egty9rRPESF91pKsy8Co8g
dBJ+jKxToCTXVN2L4BxnF6dr8FT55qrYFojobQcWrQNI4sl/X0OLscAHJegL9sH3
QNBMv0MiFk8NmXTCjFNKvTXinBlQ99VEVVVjert6KB6TRVjrEnyyPNBFMaQg2Cjz
j212Gnc/d32s5O9/9ABvdQjPYLQSM5YvNN4BsAyo2ij2fjDAnt6dYAMnTUs9deA5
4m8ME6+x5tqvAkK4aOM4AtgBrPuoezM1/euGE7hwJeL1z/RFNIkyZJcG7Mk9xI7/
0wIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Don't forget to add an additional volume (if it's necessary) with `path_to_keys` path.

**Attention**: Using this form of authorization does not imply that you can remove the TLS section from your configuration without taking further action. Your connection must remain secure. You can use your own SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt), or you can remove the TLS configuration and utilize TLS termination on your reverse proxy.

For example, you can add the following configuration for TLS with your own SSL certificate and key

```yaml
tls:
  enabled: true
  server:
    certificate: /path_to_ssl_certs/your_ssl_cert.crt
    key: /path_to_ssl_certs/your_ssl_key.p8.key
```

### Dshackle behind a reverse proxy

<Image src={proxy} alt="Reverse proxy" sizes="55vw" />

Dshackle can work behind a reverse proxy. You need to terminate SSL on your reverse proxy and run Dshackle with TLS disabled.

Example of a `docker-compose` configuration with Traefik that proxies port `12448` to `12448` on Dshackle:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:latest
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "12448:12448"
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--entryPoints.grpc.address=:12448"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=$MAIL"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
    volumes:
      - "./traefik/letsencrypt:/letsencrypt"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
  dshackle:
    image: drpcorg/dshackle:latest
    volumes:
      - "/path_to_config/dshackle.yaml:/etc/dshackle/dshackle.yaml"
      - "/path_to_keys:/path_to_keys"
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.drpc.loadbalancer.server.scheme=h2c"
      - "traefik.http.services.drpc.loadbalancer.server.port=12448"
      - "traefik.http.routers.drpc.entrypoints=grpc"
      - "traefik.http.routers.drpc.tls.certresolver=myresolver"
      - "traefik.http.routers.drpc.rule=Host(`$DOMAIN`)"
```

## Creating dRPC account

Providers can use dRPC for free, as long as they use it to query their own infrastructure. The benefits include:

1. A single interface for all your endpoints and keys
2. Detailed statistics
3. Automatic fallback mechanism

Also, we need to associate your account with the specific provider in our dRPC config. For now, this has to be done manually.

### Register on drpc.org

1. Go to https://drpc.org
2. Select your preferred authorization method (MetaMask, email, etc)
3. Go to `Settings` -> `Team`
4. Copy `Team ID` and send it to us

## Heap dumps

Now it's possible to collect heap dumps from dshackle during `OutOfMemoryError`. It could be very important for us for further troubleshooting and improve our service, send them to us as soon as possible. It's automated but it's necessary to do one thing - add another volume in your docker config - `/path_to_dumps:/etc/dshackle/dumps`.

If everything is ok you will see nothing, otherwise there will be the logs `Heap dump creation is turned off` or  `$path does not exist`. Then heap dumps will be created in the folder you specify in your docker config if OutOfMemoryError is thrown. And if so there will be the log `There are some heap dumps, please send them to dshackle developers` during the next dshackle start. This message is printed periodically just to remind about your heap dumps.

Max number of heap dumps in the folder is 3. Dshackle monitors it and automatically clears extra dumps if necessary.

## Additional info

Since **1.10.0** version ([for more info](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0)) geth abandoned of indexing all transactions by default (they take transactions from **2,350,000** last blocks). Because of that tx methods like `eth_getTransactionByHash` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` return null for old blocks. If you wish to disable transaction unindexing altogether, you can run Geth with --txlookuplimit=0. Please take this into account if you have geth nodes.
