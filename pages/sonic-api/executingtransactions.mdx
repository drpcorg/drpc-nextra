## Executing transactions

Enables sending tokens, interacting with smart contracts, and performing on-chain operations.

[eth_call](/sonic-api/executingtransactions/eth_call): Executes a contract call without broadcasting a transaction. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/sonic-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction): Sends a signed transaction to the network.

These methods are essential for executing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on Sonic.
