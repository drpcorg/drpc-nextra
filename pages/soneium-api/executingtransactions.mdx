## Executing transactions
Enables interaction with smart contracts, token transfers, and other blockchain-based operations by executing transactions.

[eth_call](/viction-api/executingtransactions/eth_call): Executes a contract call without broadcasting a transaction. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/viction-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction): Sends a signed transaction to the network.

These methods are essential for executing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on Viction.
