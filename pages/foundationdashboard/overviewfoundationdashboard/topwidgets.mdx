## Top widgets

This section displays key real-time metrics for the network:

### Status

The current network status is determined as the best status among all providers in the network over the last 5 minutes. The best status is the one with the lower priority:

```
[ProviderStatus.AVAIL_OK]: 0,
  [ProviderStatus.AVAIL_LAGGING]: 1,
  [ProviderStatus.AVAIL_IMMATURE]: 2,
  [ProviderStatus.AVAIL_SYNCING]: 3,
  [ProviderStatus.AVAIL_FORKED]: 4,
  [ProviderStatus.AVAIL_UNAVAILABLE]: 5,
  [ProviderStatus.AVAIL_UNKNOWN]: 6,
```

Here, AVAIL_OK is the best status and AVAIL_UNKNOWN is the worst.

If there were no statuses within five minutes, the status is considered `AVAIL_UNKNOWN`.

There are four states of the widget:

```
available: "Available", // green
warning: "Issues detected", // yellow
unavailable: "Unavailable", // red
"n/a": "N/A", // grey
```

Since there are more statuses than widget states, we map them to widget states as follows:

- AVAIL_OK or AVAIL_LAGGING - available
- AVAIL_UNAVAILABLE or AVAIL_UNKNOWN - unavailable
- all other statuses - warning

### Ô∏èNodes

There are two numbers in this widget.

Active nodes - the number of nodes reported by providers. May be unreliable.

We count it as sum `SUM(nodes_count)` from the table `provider_state` for the past 5 minutes.

Planned nodes - the number of nodes that we expect to have in a network. For each planned node, we manually add the following details to the `FoundationNode` table in our database:

- kind (usual or archive)
- region where the node is located
- network
- startDate
- expireDate (this is needed to mark this node as not active anymore instead of deleting it)

We count the planned nodes by checking the number of entries in this table.
Right now, there's no automation for this table; we manually insert data into the table and can delete/update it if needed.
If the foundation requests more nodes in the specific region, we'll manually add the data to this table.

### Block Propagation Time

We calculate it through the change in block height.

- Here, by "provider" we will consider the combination of provider_id + provider_index + provider_region
- For each such "provider," we calculate how much the blockHeight has changed in the last 5 minutes
- We find `max_delta` (the maximum number of blocks) and `min_delta` (the minimum number of blocks)

Min Block Propagation Time is `300 / max_delta`

Max Block Propagation Time is `300 / min_delta`

### Block Height

Counted as `MAX(block_height)` among all our providers in the network for the past 5 minutes.
