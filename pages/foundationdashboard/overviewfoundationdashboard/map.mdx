## Map

→ The map is visible only if the screen width is 1370+ pixels with the sidebar expanded, and 1215+ pixels if the sidebar is collapsed.

The map features region cards. On the cards:

Top part:

- **Region Status** — the best status from all we see among providers in this region (AVAIL_OK, AVAIL_LAGGING, ...) for the last 5 minutes, converted into a colored dot using the network status formula - see above.
- **Number of Nodes** reported by providers in this region for the last 5 minutes
- **Latency** - the average latency from this region over the last 30 minutes. This may include cross-region requests. Calculated only for certain methods (see the sidebar note).

Mid part:

- **Served % -** the percentage of requests served by providers from this region over the last 24 HOURS.

    ```
    SELECT countMerge(request_count) as request_count, provider_region as region
    FROM rpc_queries_1d_v3
    WHERE date >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOURS `
    AND network = ${networkId}
    AND provider_id IN ( ... public providers )
    GROUP BY provider_region
    ```

- **Traffic source %** - the percentage of requests from this region for the past 24 HOURS

    ```
    SELECT countMerge(request_count) as request_count, source_region as region `
    FROM rpc_queries_1d_v3
    WHERE date >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOURS
    AND network = ${networkId}
    AND provider_id IN ( ... public providers )
    GROUP BY source_region
    ```


Bottom part:

- **Coverage fit - the percentage ratio between amount of** requests from this region for the past 24 HOURS (Traffic source) and locally processed requests (when source_region = provider_region)

    ```tsx
    export function calculateRegionCoveragePercentage(
      requestsFromRegion: number,
      requestsLocallyProcessed: number
    ): number {
      // No requests from the region, coverage is 100%
      if (requestsFromRegion === 0) {
        return 100;
      }

      // More or equal served requests than requests from the region, coverage is 100%
      if (requestsLocallyProcessed >= requestsFromRegion) {
        return 100;
      }

      // Otherwise make the calculation
      const coveragePercentage =
        (requestsLocallyProcessed / requestsFromRegion) * 100;

      return coveragePercentage;
    }
    ```


If you click on the region card, the region modal will appear.
