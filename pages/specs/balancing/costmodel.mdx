# Cost model

Execution flow requires cost model so it can deduct payments for made requests.

Cost model is represented by interface

```go
type CostModel interface {
	LockCost([]RoutedRequest) error
	FinalizeCost([]RoutedRequest) error
}
```

As described in execution flow docs, it has 2 methods. Read more about how it works with execution flow [here](./overview.mdx).

### General algorithm

So given number of routed requests we want to define their cost. The simplest cost model would be just to use each call CU cost according to [this table](../../pricing/compute-units.mdx).

However, we need to take several facts into account:

1. We do not charge for requests to public providers. So, any requests to them cost 0.
2. Each provider has its own user on [drpc.org](http://drpc.org) and there is a link between their account and provider. So, if they make requests as a client, we do not charge them in case they make requests to their own provider.

### Locking cost

Using algorithm described above we first deduct payments from client according to the best case scenario.

We use each routed request strategy call `GetProviders(false)` to get the providers that we will try to use for requests.

### Finalizing cost

For each request we call `GetProviders(true)` to get actual providers that performed meaningful work. We then recalculate new cost according to this set of providers and compensate the difference (or deduct more if appropriate).
