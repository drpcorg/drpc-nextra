## Fantom API Quickstart

To get started with building on Fantom using dRPC's Fantom RPC API, follow these steps:

**1. Create a dRPC Account or Use Public Fantom RPC endpoints**

By signing up for a free dRPC account, you can access their Premium Fantom RPC endpoints.

**Public endpoints:**

HTTPS

```bash
https://fantom.drpc.org/
```

WSS:

```bash
wss://fantom.drpc.org
```

**2. Set Up Your Development Environment**

RPC can be requested in [various ways](https://drpc.org/docs/gettingstarted/firstrequest). In this example, we are going to use Node.js. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your system. You can verify their installation by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If not installed, download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

**3. Initialize Your Project**

Create a new directory for your project and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir Fantom-drpc-quickstart
cd Fantom-drpc-quickstart
npm init --yes
```

**4. Install Axios**

Axios is a popular HTTP client for making API requests. Install it using npm:

```bash
npm install axios
```

**5. Obtain dRPC Endpoint**

Log in to your dRPC account and navigate to the Fantom RPC endpoints section. Copy the HTTPS endpoint URL for the Fantom Mainnet.

**6. Write Your First Script**

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and add the following code:

```jsx
const axios = require('axios');

const url = 'https://lb.drpc.org/ogrpc?network=fantom&dkey=YOUR_DRPC_API_KEY';

const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'eth_blockNumber',
  params: []
};

axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('The latest block number is', parseInt(response.data.result, 16));
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching block number:', error);
  });
```

Replace `‘https://lb.drpc.org/ogrpc?network=fantom&dkey=YOUR_DRPC_API_KEY'` with the actual endpoint URL you obtained from dRPC.

**7. Run Your Script**

Execute your script using Node.js:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the latest Fantom block number printed in your console.

**Additional Information**

dRPC offers various features such as high performance nodes, access to multiple chains.

By following these steps, you can start building on Fantom using dRPC's reliable and efficient RPC endpoints. For more details use [Fantom Documentation](https://docs.fantom.foundation).
