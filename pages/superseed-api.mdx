## Superseed API Quickstart

To get started with building on Superseed using dRPC's Superseed RPC API, follow these steps:

**1. Create a dRPC Account or Use Public Superseed RPC endpoints**

By signing up for a free dRPC account, you can access their Premium superseed RPC endpoints.

**Public endpoints:**

HTTPS

```bash
https://superseed.drpc.org/
```

WSS:

```bash
wss://superseed.drpc.org
```

**2. Set Up Your Development Environment**

RPC can be requested in [various ways](https://drpc.org/docs/gettingstarted/firstrequest). In this example, we are going to use Node.js. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your system. You can verify their installation by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If not installed, download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

**3. Initialize Your Project**

Create a new directory for your project and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir superseed-drpc-quickstart
cd superseed-drpc-quickstart
npm init --yes
```

**4. Install Axios**

Axios is a popular HTTP client for making API requests. Install it using npm:

```bash
npm install axios
```

**5. Obtain dRPC Endpoint**

Log in to your dRPC account and navigate to the superseed RPC endpoints section. Copy the HTTPS endpoint URL for the superseed Mainnet.

**6. Write Your First Script**

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and add the following code:

```jsx
const axios = require('axios');

const url = 'https://lb.drpc.live/superseed/YOUR_DRPC_API_KEY';

const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'eth_blockNumber',
  params: []
};

axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('The latest block number is', parseInt(response.data.result, 16));
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching block number:', error);
  });
```

Replace `‘https://lb.drpc.live/superseed/YOUR_DRPC_API_KEY'` with the actual endpoint URL you obtained from dRPC.

**7. Run Your Script**

Execute your script using Node.js:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the latest Superseed block number printed in your console.

**Additional Information**

dRPC offers various fea3tures such as high performance nodes, access to multiple chains, and MEV protection. For more details, visit their [superseed API documentation](https://www.superseed.xyz).

By following these steps, you can start building on Superseed using dRPC's reliable and efficient RPC endpoints.
