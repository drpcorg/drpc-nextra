## Subscriptions

Enables real-time subscriptions to specific events through WebSockets.

[eth_subscribe](/fantom-api/subscriptions/eth_subscribe) : Subscribes to various blockchain events such as new blocks, pending transactions, or event logs. \
[eth_unsubscribe](/fantom-api/subscriptions/eth_unsubscribe) : Cancels an existing event subscription.

These endpoints are essential for real-time event tracking and monitoring on the Fantom network.
