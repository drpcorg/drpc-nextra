## Executing transactions

Enables the execution of smart contracts and on-chain operations.

[eth_call](/fantom-api/executingtransactions/eth_call) : Executes a read-only function call to a smart contract without modifying the blockchain state. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/fantom-api/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction) : Submits a raw, signed transaction to the Fantom blockchain for processing.

These endpoints are essential for interacting with smart contracts and submitting transactions on the Fantom network.
